# Immutable data.

>Any operation that would mutate a data structure in Immutable.js does not modify the original value.

> But rather returns a new value.

# Iterable

> An Iterable is a set of key/value entries that can be iterated (e.g. using .map(), .filter(), .reduce(), â€¦)

> All collections in Immutable.js, like Map and List, use Iterable as a base class. 

# Maps

> Think of Map as an object.

> .fromJS() This returns a given JS object as an Immutable.js representation,

> Converting objects into Maps, and arrays into Lists.

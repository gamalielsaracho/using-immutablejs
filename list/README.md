1. List.of():

> You will use when need creating a List from non-iterable data.
> Examples: function arguments, a javascript object, or a string that you want interpreted as a whole string.

> You will use when need creating a List from iterable data.
> Examples: an array, or an immutable iterable object (List, Map, Set, ect..), or a string that you want interpreted as a series of changes.
